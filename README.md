# ergo-telescope [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/W-M-D/ergo-telescope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/W-M-D/ergo-telescope)
A Linux based program that runs a GPS to track cosmic rays on a raspberry pi (or with some tweaking any other device with a uart port). 

### TODO- features
- [x] Configuration loading
- [ ] Find that awesome switching singal handler you had pre git 
- [x] Create user for the ergo-telescope deamon to provide restricted permissions 
- [ ] ? Psad and firewall config ? 
- [ ] Add file system full detection 
- [ ] Encryption between pis and server (?rsync via ssh with keys and accounts for each pi ? ) 
- [x] Compression of local data on the pis (not in master due to the fact that the file must be uncompressed to count bytes)
- [ ] Use of a actual local database instead of just a csv and possible mesh pi network processing/storage 
- [x] Default configuration file as well as a aviation config file 
- [ ] Better argument handling 

### TODO- Bugs
- [ ] Fix Log timestamp on boot by polling time from GPS before logging (accidently fixed by adding a boot light delay, however the time is still system time so when not on network log messages will not render time correctly)

#APT

If you don't want to build this from source you can add this line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file

deb http://packages.ergotelescope.org/debian stable/

you also need the key or else apt will not allow you to install the file

curl http://packages.ergotelescope.org/ergo.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

Then all you have to do is.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ergo-telescope


#Building
If you would just like to build a bin file for testing run
autoreconf -iv
./configure
make 

If you would like to build a .deb enter the ergo-telescope dir and run 

dpkg-checkbuilddeps 

and install missing build deps with apt-get 

Finally run 
dpkg-buildpackage

a .deb file will be created and can be installed with 

dpkg -i 

#Configuration 
As of version 1.2
To configure the raspi to your needs you can create a GPS.conf file with ucenter (https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center-windows)
and move it to /etc/ERGO/GPS.conf 
If no GPS.conf is found the progrm will only use default setting. 

As of version 1.4
To configure the raspi you need to edit the file located under /etc/ERGO/ergo-telescope.cfg and change GPS_config_file = ""; to GPS_config_file = "YOUR_FILENAME_HERE"; We currently ship with GPS_aviation.conf . This file is well suited for tests < 1g (such as a weather ballon).  

the baudrate must be 38400 for the raspi to work. 

#Debugging 
If any bugs are found please contact me. If you're really bored and want to look for bugs you can open up gdb, or radare2  in a screen
session after stoping the ergo service with the command sudo service ergo-telescope stop . However I run gperf with almost every build. 
This program does have some built in debugging features that can be activated by running the program directly with a number 1-4 after it 
(eg ergo-telescope 3) 
the number increases verbosity.
ONLY ONE ergo-telescope CAN RUN AT A TIME BECAUSE IT USES THE SAME PORT. 

#Logs
you can access logging and data by going to the /etc/ERGO directory 

Logs are under ERGO_LOGS.log and ERGO_HEX.log
Data is under ERGO_DATA.csv 
A data stamp will look like this 

Date    Time      ID    lat       lon       alt       nanoseconds
